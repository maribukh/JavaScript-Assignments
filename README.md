This repository contains multiple simple JavaScript programs designed to work with numbers and perform various operations based on user input.

Tasks Overview
1. Leap Year Checker
The user is prompted to input a year, and the program checks whether the year is a leap year or not. A leap year is:

Divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, or
Divisible by 400.
Example:

Input: 2024 → Output: Leap Year
Input: 1900 → Output: Not a Leap Year
2. Multiple of 2 or 3 Checker
The user inputs 3 numbers, and the program determines if any of them are divisible by either 2 or 3.

Example:

Input: 8, 15, 22 → Output: 8 is divisible by 2, 15 is divisible by 3
Input: 5, 7, 11 → Output: None of the numbers is divisible by 2 or 3
3. Squares of Numbers
The user inputs a number, and the program prints the square of every number from 1 up to the entered number. This is implemented using both a for loop and a while loop.

Example:

Input: 4 → Output: 1, 4, 9, 16 (for both loops)
4. Numbers Divisible by 123
The program prints all numbers between 100 and 100,000 that are divisible by 123. This is implemented using both a for loop and a while loop.

Example:

Output: 123, 246, 369, 492, ...
5. Last Digit Finder
The user inputs a number with at least 2 digits, and the program prints the last digit of that number.

Example:

Input: 25 → Output: Last digit is 5
Input: 139 → Output: Last digit is 9
